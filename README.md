### Why ?

This is a result of a conversation with a couple of friends and an [old presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQLil_SGCI) that I came across this morning. While professional athletes can improve their performance by practicing different training subject to get better performance, why cannot professional software engineers do something similar? 


Trust me, I hate the idea of practicing the same technique again and again. I also don't think  the ability of typing faster is the key the software engineering. In fact, I strongly agree with ["Typing is not the bottleneck"](http://sebastianlab.com/post/140303165/typing-is-not-the-bottleneck). However, I do agree that if I'm able to type faster, solving certain common issues with better methods,  I would benefit from it tremendously. I'd have more time to think about more important issues instead of struggling with basics. The practices could potentially lead to new product ideas, or new methods that can be applied elsewhere, or more elegant way of doing certain operations.

Readers of "Cracking the Coding Interview" may think this is the exact same thing, but my intention for this repo is totally different. The goal of the repo is just for Perfection. Solving the issues in this repo doesn't give you a free ticket to a top tech company such as FaceBook, Google or Amazon etc. . I have no intention to make it happen,  nor do I want to.  The methods provided here is certainly not only about performance. It would be a series of practice that I hope could leading myself towards a better developer path.
